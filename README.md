## Cafe digital menu proof of concept
This project aims to visualize an idea of a service for such caf√©s that minimize human interaction, and are 
productivity oriented. The idea is that instead of kiosks, which require large hardware made in small batches, 
thus tend to be rather expensive, this webapp could be ran on for example {fruit company tablet} mini or equivalent. 
This reduces costs while making UX a whole lot better and it would also make ordering from table possible. \
Another core idea (which primarily makes this service unviable in real buisnesses as there are no data to collect about consumers)
is that there are no user accounts, no downloading apps required on user side and payment can be tap to pay via nfc, since most 
devices support that nowadays. This makes the ordering process extremely streamlined. The app also contains a coffee and tea wiki 
with the most interesting facts about what makes specialty coffee stand out, so there is something to do (optional) while waiting 
for the order. \
The ui design uses elements mostly from neumorphism and techwise it utilizes the MERN stack. MongoDB is provided via cloud, the app 
is hosted on vercel. It was done for a university project, tho the idea existed in my head before that aswell.
